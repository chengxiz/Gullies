# Overview

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) is the owner of the Western New York Nuclear Service Center (WNYNSC), a 1,351 ha (3,338 ac) site located approximately 48 km (30 mi) south of Buffalo, New York. The WNYNSC was established in 1961 as the site of a commercial spent nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal facility. Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS) built and operated the spent fuel reprocessing plant and waste disposal facilities, processing 640 Mg (metric tons, or 705 short tons) of spent nuclear fuel from 1966 to 1972 under an Atomic Energy Commission license. Nuclear fuel reprocessing operations ended in 1972 and never reopened, leaving behind radioactive and chemical wastes in the NRC-Licensed Disposal Area (NDA), the New York State-Licensed Disposal Area (SDA), and the Waste Tank Farm (WTF). Dispersed contamination also exists across the Site. Given the location of the Site in a glacially-formed valley filled with sediments deposited by glacial outwash, erosion threatens to release and transport wastes and other contaminants from the West Valley Site to the larger environment. This has the potential to present risks to the environment and the persons living within it. In order to assess these risks, erosion must be addressed in the West Valley PPA Model.
